<h1>THE CONTEXT WE FIND OUR MAIN CHARACTER IN</h1>
  <p>After climate demise, Earth has been partitioned into living and dead sections. These "living sections" are large climate contorolled 
  domes where humans who could afford it, now live. People who could not, still managed to surive in the dead. In abandoned lithium 
  mines from the last great advance of technology, the excommunicated (Excoms) persist. 
  The living domes maintained by the last megacorperation, Argile, has now set their sights on total control of both living and dead sections of
  Earth. Assuming the Excoms have nothing to offer them, the senior board of Argile opted for, as stated in Section 4B i2 of
  Argile INC's quarterly report "Excom's mass displacement by quickest means necessary". This meant killing them, as astute shareholders
  were sure to pick up on. The quickest means necessary was found in Argile's newest 
  crowd pleaser, their sentient synthteic bioengineered humans AKA Ultraviolets AKA UVs. Inside the domes, UVs performed daily tasks that insiders (people who lived in
  domes) found tedious, such as reading. Outside the domes UV's were programed as leathal hunter trackers, keen on Excom blood. Initally, Excoms that lived near domes
  suffered immensly, as they were not prepared for such an onslaught, most living the peaceful life of an algea farmers deep in the LI mines.

    Argile's malicious plan was working. They worked quickely. Swooping into cleared LI mines and refurbished them into residences and shopping outlets for paying insiders, stuffing their coffers, as
  they did not have the over head of building domes in the LI mines. News travels fast among the Excoms, and word made it to outlying settlements in time to
  prepare themsevles for the raids. Many glorious battles were fought in the tunnels deep within the ground, but it was not until an observant Excom named Jean-Claude 
  had a stunning revelation. Both a valiant fighter and a staunch proponent of the Canadian Tuexedo (a style nearly a centruy old) Jean-Claude noticed when attacking a 
  UV they did not notice him until he had hit them with his mighty club. Astonished by his hand to hand, many could not phathom what was making the UVs sitting ducks to him.
  It was a down right mystery until a friend of Jean-Claude finally succumbed to his pestering to try the Canadian Tuexdo as it was a the best fighting garment. The UVs
  didn't see them until they were inches apart. Astonished, they had cracked it. Denim. There was some bug in the UVs eye sensor that made denim invisible to them. The Excoms 
  worked quickly to spread the news. A rally call echoed through and transevcer in any tunnel: denim for all, denim for you. Salvaged technology from days of past such 
  as ancient cathode ray tube televions displayed the denim savior to muster moral in the war stricken excoms, digital cameras used to capture new demin armor styles, and 
  speakers to play the Excoms most important war call. Punk.
