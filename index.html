<h1>THE CONTEXT WE FIND OUR MAIN CHARACTER IN</h1>
  <p>After climate demise, Earth has been partitioned into living and dead sections. These "living sections" are large climate contorolled 
  domes where humans who could afford it, now live. People who could not, still managed to surive in the dead. In abandoned lithium 
  mines from the last great advance of technology, the excommunicated (Excoms) persist. 
  The living domes maintained by the last megacorperation, Argile, has now set their sights on total control of both living and dead sections of
  Earth. Assuming the Excoms have nothing to offer them, the senior board of Argile opted for, as stated in Section 4B i2 of
  Argile INC's quarterly report "Excom's mass displacement by quickest means necessary". This meant killing them, as astute shareholders
  were sure to pick up on. The quickest means necessary was found in Argile's newest 
  crowd pleaser, their sentient synthteic bioengineered humans AKA Ultraviolets AKA UVs. Inside the domes, UVs performed daily tasks that insiders (people who lived in
  domes) found tedious, such as reading. Outside the domes UV's were programed as leathal hunter trackers, keen on Excom blood. Initally, Excoms that lived near domes
  suffered immensly, as they were not prepared for such an onslaught, most living a peaceful life of algea farmers deep in the LI mines. Argile's malicious plan was 
  working. They quickly swooped into cleared LI mines and refurbished them into residences and shopping malls for paying insiders, stuffing their coffers, as
  they did not have the over head of building domes in the LI mines. </p> News travels fast among the Excoms, and word made it to outlying settlements in time to
  prepare themsevles for the raids. Many glorious battles were fought in the tunnels deep within the ground, but it was not until an observant Excom named Jean-Claude 
  had a stunning revelation. Both a valiant fighter and a staunch proponent of the Canadian Tuexedo (a style nearly a centruy old) Jean-Claude noticed when attacking a 
  UV they did not notice him until he had hit one with a club.
