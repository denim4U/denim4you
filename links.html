  <p> Update from a middle level that a UV attack was beaten back. Our group is elated. Resiliance.  </p>

  <p> We stopped at a farm that hosted us today. A boutiful feast of red algae. Moral is high. Conversation around the table and the many personalities around it 
  was as dynamic and interesting as the most interesting battle. </p>
