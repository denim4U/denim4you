  <li> 15/10/2151 </li>
  <p> Crisp and cool when I wake at 06h00. Much like every other time we awake.  </p>
  <li> 16/10/2151 </li>
  <p> Update from a middle level that a UV attack was beaten back. Our group is elated. Resiliance.  </p>
  <li> 20/10/2151 </li>
  <p> We stopped at a farm that hosted us today. A boutiful feast of red algae. Moral is high. The conversation around the table and the many personalities around it 
  was as dynamic and interesting as the most interesting battle. </p>
  <li> 22/10/2151 </li>
  <p> New Canadain Tuxedo Regalia was displayed today through local CRTs on level 7. Finally they understand! </p>
  <li> 25/10/2151 </li>
  <p> The human spirit is suprising. To observe it while it plays out its day to day and while in the most heroic of situations. How it can become something so different 
  yet is the same human.</p>
  <li> 30/10/2151 </li>
  <p> Blisters. Fuck.  </p>
  <li> 01/11/2151 </li>
  <p> Give an animal a wide pasture and you will keep it content and under your possession forever. Put it in a dome, well I'm not too sure then.  </p>
  <li> 05/11/2151 </li>
  <p> Encountered 2 UVs from afar on the out reaches of tunnel 89 level 10. Did not engage as they went the opposite direction. Maybe now they fear us.  </p>
  <li> 07/11/2151 </li>
    <p> Found an artifact today from a long deceased miner. A leather container that had plastic pieces of paper with faces on them. A few cards with 16 numbers on them.
    I'm not familiar with them but I think my grandparent mentioned this to be a sort of money card or somehting. It also included a beautiful film shot of the above.
